## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexus-finance-user-base.git
cd nexus-finance-user-base
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the `nexus_finance` package available in your Python environment.

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start on port 5000 and will be in debug mode. You can access the application through your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Configuration

The simulation's strategy can be customized by modifying the `strategy` dictionary in the code:

```python
strategy = {
    "initial_invest": (10000, 50000),       # Initial investment range
    "reinvest_rate": (0.2, 0.8),            # Reinvestment rate range
    "cost_per_install": 2.0,                # Cost per user installation
    "price_per_hour": 0.18,                 # Price per hour of usage
    "target_day": 365,                      # Simulation target days
    "target_user": 10000,                   # Target number of users
    "invest_days": (0, 365),                # Range of investment days
    "reinvest_days": (0, 300),              # Range of reinvestment days
    "num_extra_invest": (0, 24),            # Range of extra investments
    "num_reinvest": (0, 24),                # Range of reinvestments
    "extra_invest": (1000, 100000),         # Extra investment range
    "extra_invest_days": (30, 300),         # Extra investment duration range
}
```

You can also modify the `types` list to define different user types and their respective parameters:

```python
types = [{
    "conversion_rate": 0.05,
    "max_days_of_activity": math.inf,
    "daily_hours": 0.5
}]
```

# UserBaseApplication

This repository contains a base application for user management built using Python. The application is designed to provide essential features for user registration, authentication, and management.

## Overview

The `UserBaseApplication` is structured to allow for easy customization and extension. It consists of the core application logic, along with routing capabilities to handle incoming requests and direct them to the appropriate handlers.

## Features

- User registration
- User authentication
- User management (CRUD operations)
- API routes setup for seamless integration
- Configurable settings for easy deployment

## Installation

To get started with `UserBaseApplication`, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UserBaseApplication.git
   cd UserBaseApplication
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python -m app
```

Ensure that you have the necessary environment variables set up, such as database connection strings and other configuration parameters.

### Application Structure

- `app.py`: The main application file that initializes the `UserBaseApplication`.
- `app_routes.py`: Contains the routing setup for the application.
- Additional directories and files may contain templates, static files, and other necessary resources.
